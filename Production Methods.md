## Virtual Design Mediums:

        Virtual mediums of design and modelling, tend to prove their use in preconceptual stages, 
        of development, providing fundamental basis for designs,
        and physical graphical replication of past versions for the purpose of revised development and production.

        For the purposes of this project, the use of virtual design mediums,
        proved to be integral in the production of an artifact through CAD Modelling, 
        however the range of available technology allowed for multiple avenues of potential developmental routes.

### 3D Scanning:

        3D scanning, on a surface level uses optical recognition of known markers,
        to be able to map and recognise an objects external geometry and mapped in a software environment.

        This technology provides an extremely intriguing method of inversely modelling an artefact,
        for the purposes for further modification to be done.

        For example, 3d scanning a clay sculpture for the purposes of designing a mounting system,
        provides you an extremely accurate model to define the mounting systems parameters and fitment,
        which via conventional methods would prove nearly impossible to replicate.

        Whilst the capabilities of 3d scanning provides the opportunity to "work backwards" in essence, 
        without a physical artifact to begin with, it inherently struggles to prove much use.
        
        Furthermore the hardware and software requirements, unless the system is entirely custom, 
        the technology can come at quite the heavy financial cost to maintain and utilise effectively,
        meaning that whilst in this circumstance the access to the technology is present,
        the volume of the contents and resolution of which the scanner collates is surplus to requirements in this case.

### Motion Capture:

        Motion capture in terms of design is potentially an unconventional medium for a project such of this,
        however, does offer some interesting insights.

        The basis of motion capture remains similar to the premises of 3D scanning,
        utilising highly reflective markers and optical image capturing to map geometry in software.

        However, in contrast to the 3D scanning process, motion capture (as per its name),
        focuses on the mapping of the motion of an object, allowing critical evaluation as to the degrees of freedom (DOF),
        within a required system.

        Unfortunately, as per the nature of motion capture, similar to that of 3D scanning the cost and space of operation is highly considerable,
        furthermore due to specialist software and system integration, the file mediums are not the most transferable between software,
        without a number of intermediary programs for conversion between file types.

### Haptic Sculpting:

        Haptic sculpting as a process is more descriptive of haptic feedback in peripheral devices, 
        typically this sort of force feedback system is seen in simulated racing games,
        where the steering wheel peripheral device will provide inverse forces based on software parameters,
        and cases for more responsive and intuitive feedback and design.

        Haptic sculpting in these circumstances, was available in the form of a haptic pen,
        which when integrated within the software allowed for intuitive design with an admittedly surreal nature,
        of feeling a software based artefact, physically.

        While this technology offered more versatility, the design methods of the haptic pen lent itself more towards voxel based sculpting methods,
        for surface detail, allowing for in cases where the artefact required high amounts of small meticulous detail.

        Potentially this could prove to be a useful utensil in the project, however the value of the force feedback,
        and its related improvement in the ability to virtually design artefacts could be argued one way,
        or another based on experience with computer aided designing before hand as to how useful the haptic pen would prove in the process.

### CAD Programs:

        Computer aided design, typically refers to a range of programs which is intended for some degree of design,
        for the most part the software is specialised for three dimensional integration, 
        however CAD can also be utilised for designing purposes in two dimensional space for the purpose of CNC machines, 
        laser cutters or similar means of production.

        Due to the popularity of CAD programs, multiple companies have their own offerings in terms of platforms and systems, 
        typically the programs either have varying functionalities, intended audiences or levels of accessibility, 
        to create a point of access for a diverse range of users.

        As a result of the diversity of potential platforms, depending on user experience and their respective intentions,
        with the program for their end product, the software can generate significant alterations as to how the end product is created.

#### Fusion 360:

        Fusion 360 is arguably one of the most prevalent design, program for general use, focusing on being a versatile 3D and 2D modelling tool,
        with an impressive extent of rendering capabilities for more artefacts on more of a display focused element.

        An element particular of interest within the fusion 360 library of functionality is the generative design capabilities,
        of which though the incorporation of A.I. given general design parameters, the software designs with a degree of autonomy, 
        the method isn't without failure.
        
        However, generative design can provide the majority of the concept in terms of design for a CAD model,
        even with the ability to place priority in design to achieve certain properties of the design, 
        should that be reduced weight of the part, or increasing the strength throughout a structure.

        As a result, fusion proves to be an extremely viable platform for the development of relatively structured articles,
        however for more dynamic and fluid structures, perhaps character creation or high-resolution models, 
        the software tends not to be as ideal for manipulating and modifying models.

#### Blender:

        Blender could be considered as something as a mixed bag as it can be used for the purposes of CAD,
        however it also has an area of integration in animation and game design.

        As a result, the purposes of blender tend towards that of less rigid artefacts,
        #and trend towards high resolution abstract works, for example sculpt work on dynamic pieces.

        Whilst given blenders animation and high resolution capabilities, 
        blender offers a high range of versatility for the creation and display of virtual assets.

#### Auto Desk 123D:

        Auto Desk 123D, is not exactly a typical program which would be discussed in development, 
        mainly due to the fact that the software was discontinued by Autodesk in 2017, 
        due to an over complicated portfolio (Auto desk, 2017), 
        however there's a level of discussion to be had as their current portfolio consists of a similar number of offerings.

        It could be further argued that they had a desire to eliminate their past software due to the programs being free and extremely accessible, f
        or the compromise of creating a universal subscription model.

        However, Since corporate business model transitioning is not the aim of this document, we'll avoid the subject.

        123D as a platform provides an extremely accessible and intuitive design approach most commonly for 3D assets, 
        however is capable of 2D designs should it be required.

        The main issues presented by the program is due to the age, unless a user has an old installation, like myself, 
        or use less than legitimate means of sourcing the original files, its not easy to gain access, 
        further problems is the program is capable of texturing components, however not for rendering, 
        which for lower end devices attempting CAD to a relatively complex degree is still capable of managing the workload.
        
        However, as a result, loading in complex mesh's will result in significant performance limitations,
        therefore for object creation.
        The software is incredibly useful, this may potentially be due to having 8 years of experience with the program,
        and many fantastic results, including the majority of components produced for this project, 
        my opinion may be somewhat skewed...

        However, for more complex file editing and mesh manipulation alternative programs should ideally be used.

#### Mesh Mixer:

        Mesh Mixer similar to 123D is a no longer fully supported program from Autodesk, 
        often considered a partner app to 123D for the purposes of repairing object meshes.

        The software offers a decent range of sculpting capabilities, 
        however unlike 123D provides a relatively low performance, high resolution mesh editing facility, 
        therefore proving extremely useful in terms of catering for the functionality which 123D, 
        as a stand alone would struggle to manage internally.

        The main issue with mesh mixer as a result of being perceived as an extra tool to 123D, 
        is the fact that the software has relatively minimal functionality as a standalone,
        whilst the software can be configured to operate in 3d printer parameters,
        and sometimes even with the added capabilities of a slicer.
        
        Mesh Mixer and 123D, tend to be quite closely associated for good reason, as in order to maintain a universal solution for most CAD purposes,
        the two programs co-incide well together.
        
        Unfortunately, since this has been discontinued, similar to 123D, access has been somewhat limited.
        Thankfully, I have access to the original installation, therefore between the two programs, 
        having a great range of free and intuitive tools for the purposes of the project.

#### Tinker CAD:

        Tinker CAD , unlike the other software discussed, is partially web based, offering arguably the most accessible platform for CAD work, 
        and due to offloading most of the functionality through Tinker CAD's greater service as a whole, 
        it is capable of being utilised without higher end specifications in device, 
        unfortunately I have found the program somewhat unintuitive and even temperamental based on internet connection at certain times, 
        while as a quick utensil for either viewing or using their library of premade components, for higher level CAD creations,
        it does not prove to be the most reliable of programs.

## Physical Production Mediums:

Physical Design mediums, refers to methods of which we can take most of the resultant components of the previously discussed virtual mediums and through various means generate a physical item in various methods and materials, depending on the variation of circumstances, and the requirements of the component.

### 3D printing

        3D printing is considered as one method of "additive manufacturing" which contrary to most mediums such as milling and CNC machines, 
        rather than material being removed to generate a structure, 
        the component is actually formed through adhesion and the addition of material to the work area.

        This technology has become relatively well commercialised and widely available, 
        it has also taken a variety of differing formats and capabilities as such, 
        however the two main mediums we are concerned with are SLA and FDM, for the purposes of this project.

#### FDM VS SLA:

        FDM represent the typical form of molten plastic based substances being manipulated and formed via specialised scripting called g-code,
        generated in an external program called a slicer, this method of 3D printing, 
        whilst being a perceived majority of current available 3D printing,
        was not the first method of which the premise of a 3D printer was made.

        The first 3D printer was made in 1981 by Dr Hideo Kodama, and took the method of making a SLA 3D printer,
        a printer with the basis of using a "vat" of material typically resin, placed on a display,
        which similar to a slicer displays the individual layers of a model and hardens the resin to generate the layers on an upside down print surface,
        the axis then moves upwards then hardens another layer.

        SLA and FDM while fundamentally a similar concept,
        as a result offer hugely different benefits and consequences as a result of their differences.

        Typical issues found with SLA is that due to the resin used in the printers being UV sensitive, 
        they require containment to prevent undesired defect in the printed component, 
        further more the vat capacity tends to be relatively minimal requiring a level of intervention , 
        and unlike FDM, it is not necessarily apparent when there is a lacking of source material.

        Further tribulations of the SLA process it the clean-up process required after the production of the part, 
        due to residual resin remaining on the surface of the part, 
        the component requires a Isopropyl alcohol cleaning (or similar substitute), 
        followed by further cleaning, and a curing process,
        as a result even thought the print time of resin 3d printers on a quality basis tends to be a faster process than FDM,
        the finishing of an item takes much longer.

        However, as a result of the use of curable resin, 
        the resolution of the print tends to provide much higher accuracy and resolution to the designed component, 
        in comparison to FDM, meaning that for extremely high detail structures which require either high precision, 
        or a high measure of surface detail, this method tends to pose the most suitable option.

        On the other hand, FDM as a 3d printing method offers a arguably more appropriate rapid prototyping medium,
        due to the reduction In post print maintenance, and the greater range of usable materials, 
        FDM does arguably prove to be the more suitable method, 
        also related to my personal 5 years of experience with regards FDM 3D printing, 
        optimising and streamlining the FDM production process,
        proves easier and more reliable for the duration of this projects rapid prototyping method.

        Typically, FDM utilises a material known as PLA (poly lactic acid) a very versatile starch based plastic,
        however due to the significant heating of the plastic during the printing process,
        it has been found to release potentially harmful particulates, 
        which raises moderate concern over the safety of being in close proximity to the printer while in operation,
        therefore a contained environment is recommended, (unless you live life on the edge, like myself).

        Alternatively FDM can use materials such as ABS, an oil based plastic with high strength,
        but proves to have a high contraction therefore difficult to print,
        TPU, a flexible material allowing for more creative ways and further use cases of 3D printed parts,
        however due to elasticity proves difficult due to getting "chewed up" within the feeding gears of the 3D printer, 
        and even materials to the extent of carbon fibre can be printed with due to using a base plastic infused with carbon fibre,
        however due to the abrasiveness of the infusion can result in damage to the nozzle,
        should the nozzle not be of suitable tempering to endure the material.

        Overall, both methods offer great versatility in terms of what can be produced within a rapid time frame,
        for the product development cycle, for the project, however the capabilities and familiarity with not only using,
        but designing to FDM 3D printer parameters and requirements will most likely prove to be the most prevalently used element within this project.

### Laser cutting

        Laser cutting, as a process and in terms of hardware is remarkably similar to that of 3d printing, 
        utilising two instead of three axis' of movement, to manipulate a laser module.

        However, as a result of only utilising two axis for cutting,
        laser cutters are capable of efficiently cutting and engraving,
        by varying the intensity of the laser, allows for extremely high precision in the components produced.

        For the basis of this project there is not a requirement for this, however depending on the laser cutter,
        there is a limit to the thickness and capable materials which can be utilised,
        as typically the majority of materials produce some harmful particulates, 
        not necessarily desirable to be taken in a person's respiratory system.

### Resin Casting

        Resin casting as a method for the project,
        would be utilised for the re casting of a premade part into a substituted material.

        Utilising a silicone cast of components allows for a high precision master solid component to be produced,
        cast, then re cast In higher quantities and shorter durations,
        as a means of changing the properties of a components initial construction to a substitute structure. 
        
        This would prove useful in many cases; however, resin casting inherently has some potential issues with the process.

        For example moulds made of components can be used a couple of times, 
        however result in either mould degradation or complete destruction, 
        it is possible to prevent this with fibre glass reinforcement, however to maintain accuracy of the mould, 
        the master component would have to be recast if produced in large enough quantities, 
        fortunately due to the prototype nature of this project, whilst a few castings may be done,
        the requirement to consider the longevity of moulding components does not need heavy evaluation.
